        <h2 id="aetees" class="small-heading">King Aetees</h2>
        <p>
          Beholed the glory of our Kind Aetees, son of Helios, God of the Sun,
          and of the nymph Perseis. First King of Corinth, he decided to leave
          Greece and built the Kingdom of Colchis. The Golden Fleece was given
          to him by Phrixos in exchange of his daughter Chalciope. King Aetees
          have another daughter, the beautiful Medea. He also had a lot of
          spouses, but by respect to Queen Idiya, we shall not name them. King
          Aetees has promised Jason the Golden Fleece if he could perform
          certain tasks, which remain to be seen.

      <div>
        <h2 id="madea" class="small-heading">Princess Madea</h2>
        <p>
          Princess Medea is the daughter of our King and our Queen. She is,
          hence, a direct descendant of the Sun God Helios. She also has a deep
          connection with Hecate, the Goddess of Magic, which explaines why she
          possesses magical capabilities. Some say she will be the main actor of
          a terrible greek tragedy. To be continued...
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2 id="idiya" class="small-heading">Queen Idiya</h2>
        <p>
          Not much is known about our beloved Queen Idiya. She is the daughter
          of Titan's children, Oceanus and Tethys (they are brother and sister
          but fear not our Queen is perfectly healthy). She has 3000 sisters
          known as the Oceanids and 3000 brothers known as the Patamoi. The
          whole family is pretty close to the water element. Queen Idiya has the
          reputation of being very wise and some say she could be the goddess of
          knowledge.
